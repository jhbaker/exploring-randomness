The final demo code for my talk, "Exploring Randomness With Generative Art"


## To run it locally:
The easiest way is to watch the first two videos in [this series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j0UDiN7my4&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA) by Daniel Shifman over at [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw).

Once you have a basic project up and running, you should be able to figure out how to run this code locally. It's the exact same process.
If all else fails, follow along with the videos above, and replace that `sketch.js` with this `sketch.js`.

## Why is this code so ugly?
What a great question! This code was written for readability - it is used in a demo that does not require knowledge of Javascript. As such, I'm not trying to be optimal or flashy - I just need the code to work, and to be clear to people without JS experience.

## To remember:
#### 1. Generative art is meant to be fun.
  Break things and see what happens! As the great Bob Ross said, "We don't make mistakes. We just have happy accidents."
#### 2. Share your results.
  I would love to see your work! Post it. Tag me in it. @jhbaker_
#### 3. Don't sell these images.
   This code is free for a reason. Don't sell images produced from this code - profit from the knowledge and inspiration.
