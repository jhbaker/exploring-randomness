# exploring-randomness
The final demo code for my talk, "Exploring Randomness With Generative Art"

======

## To run it locally:
The easiest way is to watch the first two videos in [this series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j0UDiN7my4&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA) by Daniel Shifman over at [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw).

Once you have a basic project up and running, you should be able to intuit how to run this code locally.
If all else fails, follow along with the videos above, and replace that `sketch.js` with this `sketch.js`.

## To remember:
#### 1. Generative art is meant to be fun.
  Break things and see what happens! As the great Bob Ross said, "We don't make mistakes. We just have happy accidents."
#### 2. Share your results.
  I would love to see your work! Post it. Tag me in it.
#### 3. Don't sell these images.
   This shouldn't have to be said, but don't print images created by this code and sell them.
   This code is free for a reason. Don't profit off of the code - profit from the knowledge and inspiration.
